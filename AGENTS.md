# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

## Testing
- Run `bash -n setup.sh` for syntax check.
- Run `./setup.sh` to install build dependencies.
- Run `qmake6 -version` to verify qmake6 is installed.
- Run `make -j2` from the repository root; expected to fail due to missing Qt modules if environment is not fully satisfied.
