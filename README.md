QCamber is developed in the hope to provide high quaility open source PCB design/viewer suite for everyone. Anyone can contribute to the project and the project is guaranteed to be free and open source in the future.

QCamber currently only supports Valor ODB++ format, but with the help of a sister project [ipc2581_to_odb](https://github.com/Cobra-Kao/ipc2581_to_odb), IPC2851 format will be support in the future.
